# Section 11: The Well Architected Framework

This section will cover an in-depth overview on AWS Application Services.

### Business Benefits of Cloud
* Almost zero upfront infrastructure investment
* Just-in-time infrastructure
* More efficient resource utilization
* Usage-based costing
* Reduced time to market

### Technical Benefits of Cloud
* Automation - "Scriptable infrastructure"
* Auto-scaling
* Proactive scaling
* More efficient development lifecycle
* Improved testability
* Disaster recovery and business continuity
* "Overflow" the traffic to the cloud

### Design for Failure
Rule of thumb: be a pessimist when designing architectures in the cloud; assume things will fail. In other words, always design, implement and deploy for automated recovery from failure.

### Decouple Your Components
The key is to build components that do not have tight dependencies on each other, so that if one component were to die, sleep, or reamin busy for some reason, the other components in the system are built so as to continue to work as if no failure is happening.

### Implement Elasticity
The cloud brings a new concept of elasticity in your applications. Elasticity can be implemented in three ways:
1. Proactive cyclic scaling: periodic scaling that occurs at fixed interval (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
2. Proactively event-based scaling: scaling just when you are expecting a big surge of traffic requests due to a scheduled business event (new product launch, marketing campaigns)
3. Auto-scaling based on demand. By using a monitoring service, your system can send triggers to take appropriate actions so that it scales up or down based on metrics (utilization of the servers or network i/o for instance)

### Secure Your Application
Depending on your setup, securing your application is important, see Figure 11-2 on application security at different levels of the application.

### What is a well architected framework?
This has been developed by the Solution Architecture team based on their experience with helping AWS customers. The well architected framework is a set of questions that you can use to evalute how well your architecture is aligned to AWS best practices.

### Five Pillars of The Well-Architected Framework
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance efficiency
* Cost optimization
* Operational excellence

### Structure of each Pillar
* Design principles
* Definition
* Best practices
* Key AWS services
* Resources

### General Design Principles
* Stop guessing your capacity needs
* Test systems at production scale
* Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
* Allow for evolutionary architectures
* Data-driven architectures
* Improve through game days
