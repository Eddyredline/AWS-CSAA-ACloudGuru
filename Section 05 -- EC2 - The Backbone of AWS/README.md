# Section 5: EC2 - The Backbone of AWS

This section will cover an in-depth overview on the AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.

### What is EC2?
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

### EC2 Options
* On Demand - Allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second) with no commitment
* Reserved - Provides you with a capacity reservation and offers a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 year terms
* Spot - Enables you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times
* Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for you use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses

### On Demand
* Perfect for users that want the low cost and flexibility of EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment
* Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
* Applications being developed or tested on EC2 for the first time

### Reserved
* Applications with steady state or predictable usage
* Applications that require reserved capacity
* Users can make up-front payments to reduce their total computing costs even further
  * Standard RIs (up to 75% off on-demand)
  * Convertible RIs (up to 54% off on-demand) feature the capability to change the attributes of the RI as long as the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value
  * Schedule RIs are available to launch within the time window you reserve. This option allows you to match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, week, or month

### Spot
* Applications that have flexible start and end times
* Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices
* Users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity

### Dedicated Hosts
* Useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
* Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
* Can be purchased on-demand (hourly)
* Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price

### What is EBS?
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Storage) allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device. EBS volumes are placed in a specific AZ where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

### EBS Volume Types
* General Purpose SSD (GP2)
  * General purpose, balances both price and performance
  * Ratio of IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up to 300 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at 3334 GB and above
* Provisioned IOPS SSD (101)
  * Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases
  * Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
  * Can provision up to 20,000 IOPS per volume
* Throughput Optimized HDD (ST1)
  * Big data
  * Data warehouses
  * Log processing
  * Cannot be a boot volume
* Cold HDD (SC1)
  * Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads
  * File server
  * Cannot be a boot volume
* Magnetic (Standard)
* Lowest cost per GB of all EBS volume types that is bootable. Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important

### EC2 Exam Tips
* Know On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, and Dedicated Host EC2 services
* If a Spot instance is terminated by EC2, you will not be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the instance yourself, you will be charged for the complete hour in which the instance ran
* Know FIGHT DR MC PX acronym (EC2 instance types, specialties and use cases)
* SSD:
  * General Purpose SSD - Balance price and performance for a wide variety of workloads
  * Provisioned IOPS SSD - Highest performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or high-throughput workloads

* Magnetic:
  * Throughput Optimized HDD - Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads
  * Cold HDD - Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
  * Magnetic - Previous generation. Can be boot volume
